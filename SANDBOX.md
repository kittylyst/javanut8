# 🚀 Welcome to the Java in a Nutshell O'Reilly Sandbox!

This sandbox is designed to help you experiment with Java 17 code while following *Java in a Nutshell*. You can run, modify, and test examples from the book without needing to set up a local development environment.

## 📌 Getting Started

1. **Choose a chapter** – Navigate to the relevant section of the book.
2. **Run the code** – Use the built-in terminal or execution environment.
3. **Modify & Experiment** – Try tweaking the code to see how it works!
4. **Learn by Doing** – Use the *Java in a Nutshell* sandbox to practice and reinforce concepts discussed in the book.

## 🛠 Features

- Preloaded with examples from *Java in a Nutshell* 📖
- Interactive coding environment ⚡
- No manual setup required—just start coding! 🚀

## ❓ Need Help?

If you run into issues:
- Refer to the book for explanations and exercises.
- Check out the **Java in a Nutshell** GitHub repo
- Experiment—learning happens when you explore!

## 🦾 Going Further

The sandbox project uses some more advanced Java technologies that are not
included in the core language (& which are not covered in the book in any
detail).

These are primarily *Maven*, the most popular tool for building Java projects
and *JUnit*, the most popular unit testing library.

Learning these two tools, along with *git*, will help you move beyond just
simple examples to real Java projects and help you start your journey as a
Java software engineer!

Happy coding! 🎉
